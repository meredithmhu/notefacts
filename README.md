# FINAL PROJECT: NOTEFACTS :notebook: :pencil2:
Notefacts, an app that helps you organize your ideas while writing.

## Description
Notefacts, an app that helps you organize your ideas while writing. When doing the first draft of an essay, people typically brainstorm ideas they want to incorporate into the final paper and collect research on one bulleted list haphazardly. There isn't any way to drag and drop items in bulleted lists in woord processors. We wish you could bring the drag and drop functionality of a Google Keep checkbox list to the normal bulleted lists of Google Docs or Word. The app would also help you sort the bullets into common parts of an essay, such as paragraphs, topic sentences, conclusions. and expositions.
